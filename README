Mac OS Build Instructions
=========================

- install libvlc from brew formula. Note: brew's x264 will prevent libvlc from linking:

brew unlink x264
brew install libvlc --HEAD
brew link x264

- now you should be able to build y60vlc with the standard CMAKE toolchain

Windows Build Instructions
==========================

- Download the precompiles binaries from http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/win32/last/ and extract them somewhere (set the VLC_DIR enviroment var to point to it)
  - Note: make sure the %VLC_DIR%/sdk subdirectory exists. The last time I checked, it was missing the the zip, but existed in the 7z archive
  - Note: the currently included vlc.lib seems to be broken, causing a load-time error. Replacing the vlc.lib with https://code.google.com/p/vc-libvlc/ helped

- add %VLC_DIR% to the PATH
- set VLC_PLUGIN_PATH to %VLC_DIR%\plugins

Mac OS Build Instructions
=========================

- install libvlc ((a) or (b)):

  (a) from brew formula:
      $ brew tap tomahawk-player/homebrew-tomahawk
      $ brew install vlc --HEAD
      
  (b) use installed vlc in /Applications:
      edit cmake config accordingly
      - LIBVLC_INCLUDE_DIR = '/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/include'
      - LIBVLC_LIBRARY = '/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/libvlc.dylib'
 
      $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/lib


- now you should be able to build y60vlc with the standard CMAKE toolchain
- set VLC_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/vlc/plugins (or: /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/plugins)


Windows Build Instructions
==========================

- Download the precompiles binaries from http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/win32/last/ and extract them somewhere (set the VLC_DIR enviroment var to point to it)
  - Note: make sure the %VLC_DIR%/sdk subdirectory exists. The last time I checked, it was missing the the zip, but existed in the 7z archive

- add %VLC_DIR% to the PATH
- set VLC_PLUGIN_PATH to %VLC_DIR%\plugins

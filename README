Mac OS Build Instructions
=========================

- install libvlc from brew formula:

brew tap tomahawk-player/homebrew-tomahawk
brew install vlc --HEAD

- now you should be able to build y60vlc with the standard CMAKE toolchain
- set VLC_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/vlc/plugins

Windows Build Instructions
==========================

- Download the precompiles binaries from http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/win32/last/ and extract them somewhere (set the VLC_DIR enviroment var to point to it)
  - Note: make sure the %VLC_DIR%/sdk subdirectory exists. The last time I checked, it was missing the the zip, but existed in the 7z archive

- add %VLC_DIR% to the PATH
- set VLC_PLUGIN_PATH to %VLC_DIR%\plugins
